**A universal app for identity & payments. Smooth, secure, and self-sovereign.**

Welcome to the official GitHub organization for **Portal**: the user-facing interface to a fully decentralized identity and payment protocol. Portal makes it easy for anyone to log in, pay, and prove who they are without passwords or platform lock-in.

**🕳️ What Is Portal?**

**Portal** is a mobile app that manages your digital identity, your public key,  and acts as a secure approval layer for sensitive operations:

* ✅ Authorize passwordless logins

* 🤝 Approve single or recurring payments

* 🔐 Share zero-knowledge proofs of documents like passports or driver's licenses

Behind the scenes, Portal is a **client** of a **decentralized FOSS protocol** we're developing. This protocol powers the logic and trust model — Portal simply gives users a clean, friendly interface to access it all.

**🛠️ Built with:**

For the mobile application We used typescript and for the underlying protocol We used Rust

**📲 What Can You Do with Portal?**

* Log in without usernames or passwords

* Approve subscriptions and one-time payments with a tap

* Authenticate in person using your device

* Link any Nostr Wallet Connect-compatible wallet

* Share proofs of identity without leaking personal data

Portal doesn’t custody your keys, funds, or data.
